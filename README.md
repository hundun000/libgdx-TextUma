This project created in [Everything is text Jam 1](https://itch.io/jam/everything-is-text-1/rate/1659803). Use game engine `libgdx`.

## TextUma

Horse management and racing simulation game. 

The schedule is given. In the train-day, you can train your horse for improving its speed, stamina and power. In the race-day, your horse will run with rivals and win prize for you. The race's process will show as a text-base animation.

**In this demo version,** the schedule is designed simply and there is no specific goal of the game. Just shows how the horse's abilities affect the race's process and result.
